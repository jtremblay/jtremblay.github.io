## At long last our paper showing that chemical dispersants enhance oil degradation is out in the ISME Journal!
Many thanks to all collaborators on this paper. The paper highlights the importance of the Thalassolituus microbe for oil degradation in presence of chemical dispersants. This study is a good exemple of application of bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing technology to survey the organisms present in environmental samples and study the differential expression of their genes under varying experimental conditions.
