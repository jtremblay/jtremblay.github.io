### Our paper comparing Canada's west and east coasts oil degradation by microbial communities is out in Environment Microbiology!
Latest piece by our group @NRC_CNRC in collaboration with @FishOceansCAN . Large-scale shotgun MG + MT study investigates natural oil degrading microbe abundances and gene expression in the presence of dispersants in simulated oil spill in Canada's west and east coasts.
Many thanks to all collaborators on this paper. The paper highlights the importance of the Oleispira and Thalassolituus microbe for oil degradation in presence of chemical dispersants. This study is another good example of application of bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing technology to survey the organisms present in environmental samples and study the differential expression of their genes under varying experimental conditions.
