## Data visualization
A really interesting paper on data visualization. Do you know how your data is distributed? ;-)

“Most papers presented continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics.”
